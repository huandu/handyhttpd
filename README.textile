h1. handyhttpd - A Handy HTTP Server

A handy http server to enable public http access on any folder within a few seconds.
It can only serve static files.

h2. Quick Tutorial

First of all, build the binary on your server. You have to install "go":http://golang.org/ before you start.

<pre>
git clone http://github.com/huandu/handyhttpd
cd handyhttpd
go build
</pre>

Then you should have got a binary file "handyhttpd". Copy it to a dir in $PATH.
Run it in any dir you want public http access.

<code>
[user@server /your/dir/for/http]$ handyhttpd
</code>

It's done. You can visit your dir in any browser thru url http://server-ip:9696/http/

Base url is the dir running the handy. You can change the url by using <code>--alias</code> option.

By default, the handy will listen port 80. If it fails (e.g. not a root account
or 80 is in use), it will use port 9696 instead. You can also use
<code>--port</code> option to change it to your favorate number.

As you may notice soon, the handy has no deamon mode. You have to manually use
<code>nohup</code> and <code>&</code> to hide it in background.

<code>
[user@server /your/dir/for/http]$ nohup handyhttpd &
</code>

Luckily, you just need to do that once. There will only one handy instance in your
system. Further calls to the handy are simply to notify the running instance
and exit instantly.

If you want to disable http access on a dir any more, just go to that dir
and run the handy with <code>--remove</code> option.

Last but not least, use following command to shutdown the handy completely.

<code>
[user@server ~]$ handyhttpd --quit
</code>

h2. Advanced Usage

Sorry, there is no advanced usage. It's just a very very simple httpd. :P

Use <code>--help</code> to explore all handyhttpd options and have fun.
